# DESCRIPTION

A function that does the following:

1. Creates a shopping list array named "myList" where the first element in each sub-array contains a string with the name of the item and the second
element is a number representing the quantity i.e. [“Macbook Pro 2020”, 2].
2. Uses Javascript’s built-in Array methods to remove the first and last elements in the myList array and saves them in another array in the same order.
3. Uses yet another Array method to replace the 3rd element in the myList Array with [“Orange Juice”,
17].
4. Loops through the myList Array and prints an object to the console using the first element of each sub-array as the key and the second element as the value of the object.
